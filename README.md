  Woggy is basically what Boggle always wanted to be, if only it had been born in the Information Age! Dynamic timer, built-in definitions, and an overhaul to the scoring system that rebalances it in favor of long words!

##  Installation

1. If you don't already have Python installed, install it by [visiting here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
2. Download the [game .zip file](https://github.com/senthenastydynast2/Woggy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
3. Unpack it to a folder of your choice.  
4. Run **run.bat**.

##  How to Play / Core Mechanics

If you don't know how to play Boggle, I suggest you look that up first, since the core gameplay is identical to Boggle. Search for words and type away. Only words 3 letters and up are considered, and you can't go over the same letter twice.

### Controls

- **Spacebar**: Rotates the board clockwise. This does not alter the current tile distribution, but is very useful in getting a new perspective on the board.
- **ESC:** Pauses the game. The timer freezes, and tiles go blank until it is unpaused.

### Board Generation

Depending on your game type, a board will be generated at random (no curated boards here, unlike other Boggle wannabe apps!) based on a probability chance for each letter. The probability of a given letter to appear on the board is the same as that of in a game of Scrabble. For example, out of the 100 tiles in a standard Scrabble game, "E" has 12 tiles, and "Q" has 1. Therefore, E has a 12% chance of appearing in a given tile, and Q has a 1% chance. This creates a natural distribution of letters that would be as similar as possible to a competitive Scrabble game.

### Summary Screen

At the end of each round, you will be shown a summary of your performance, including your rank letter, round score, badges earned, a list of possible words that you missed (in black) and words that you correctly guessed (in green) with their respective scores:

### Board Classification (Background Colors)

What makes Woggy unique to other Boggle clones is its dynamic timer and scoring system. Why would we play for 3:00 minutes on a board that only has 10 words? When you start a board, the total possible score for it is calculated, and a board classification is assigned to it depending on how much potential there is on the board. For very closed boards, the timer is shrunk to as little as 15 seconds and the background turns **red** to indicate a sense of urgency. This type of board will more challenge your speed on finding the few words available. On the other hand, boards with huge score potentials have more exotic background colors, such as sky blue, purple, and green, and feature much longer times (up to 300 seconds!). 

The background color gives you a hint on how to play: You will want to hurry up on the reddish boards and change your playstyle for more relaxed play on lighter-colored boards.

## Scoring Rules

Each tile in Woggy scores the same amount as it does in an official Scrabble board * 10. For example, E = 10, F = 40, Q = 100, etc. In its pure form, the word SQUADS would be worth 160 points.

The main difference in scoring is that longer words now have a much higher weight to them due to **score multipliers**. The longer the word, the higher the score multiplier (as opposed to a measly flat bonus the original Boggle grants). This is a great implementation for those who love to seek long words in the board, and it properly compensates players who have the skill required to find them. Here is how much each word is affected by its length:


<div align="center">

| Word Length | Multiplier |
|-------------|------------|
| 3 letters   | **1x**     |
| 4 letters   | **1.25x**  |
| 5 letters   | **1.5x**   |
| 6 letters   | **1.75x**  |
| 7 letters   | **2x**     |
| 8 letters   | **2.5x**   |
| 9 letters   | **3x**     |
| 10 letters  | **4x**     |
| 11 letters  | **5x**     |
| 12 letters  | **6x**     |
| 13 letters  | **7x**     |
| 14 letters  | **8x**     |
| 15 letters  | **10x**    |
| 16 letters  | **12x**    |

</div>
With this scoring logic, SQUADS will be worth 280 points, instead of its base 160. While this scoring system might seem a bit overboard, keep in mind that words longer than 9 or 10 are quite rare to find. In the rare occassion that one does exist, one will be properly compensated for finding it.
